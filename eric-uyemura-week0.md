#### 1. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  

The one thing that we did that helped me the most was pair programming.  That time was very helpful, because if I got stuck, I had people to seek for help, and not only that, multiple different groups who were using their own approaches to answering the questions which gave new fresh ideas and perspectives.  Thanks for a great first week!
