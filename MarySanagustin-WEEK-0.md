#### 1. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  

Pair programming has been extremely helpful for me. I learned a lot about myself both as a driver and a navigator. I can tend to think to fast as a driver and have a hard time both thinking critically about the code and physically typing it. I was finding that I was making some very basic syntax errors or forgetting small details because my brain was trying so hard to figure out the logic. Switching between driving and navigating was a great way to help prevent mental fatigue because navigating provided a different pace.
