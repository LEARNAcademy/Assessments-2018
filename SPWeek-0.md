#### 1. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  

Alternating between lecture and practice is very helpful for me. Lecture introduces the concepts but it's hard to know which little details will be the most valuable until we start to practice. Then, regrouping and having a chance to ask questions, discuss pseudo coding logic, and dive deeper into the concept connects the theory to the practice. I know there is value in getting stuck and feeling frustrated, but extended periods of this seem counterproductive. I'm very happy to be at Learn and really enjoy all the instructors and staff. You guys are great! Thanks for all you do.
