# Week 4 Assessment

Try your best to answer each question on your own before looking up the answer online. Once you're done writing your first answer, you can google the question and write the best answer you find.


#### 1. What is a method in Ruby? How is it different or similar to functions in JavaScript?
a method in ruby is essentially a function in javascript. they both work the same and are just called different things.

#### 2. What does it mean that a class inherits from another class? Try to explain Ruby inheritance.


[Your Answer]
the child class inherits from the parent class and is then called a subclass

[Googled Answer]
In object-oriented programming, inheritance enables new objects to take on the properties of existing objects. A class that is used as the basis for inheritance is called a superclass or base class. A class that inherits from a superclass is called a subclass or derived class.

#### 3. What is rspec and what is the general process for writing tests in RSpec?

//Your Answer
rspec is used for testing ruby code to make sure your code is working properly bit by bit. the general process for writing rspec testing is to write a fail and then write one that passes and to test pieces of code as you go. write testing before you write your code to help you navigate your code.

//Googled Answer
RSpec is a 'Domain Specific Language' (DSL) testing tool written in Ruby to test Ruby code.[4] It is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework which is extensively used in the production applications.

#### 4. Name three possible non-inheritance relationships between ruby objects?

//Your Answer
has_many
belongs_to
has_one

#### 5. What do we call the #{} convention used below? What is it accomplishing?

```ruby
x = 1022
puts "I am printing a random number #{x}"
```
this is a hash and it is another way to store objects!

#### 6. How do you feel about testing right now? What potential pros/cons/barriers/advantages do you see to implementing BDD in your own code?

//Your Answer
i feel good about testing and feel it can be very helpful when writing code. but am still uncomfortable writing it

#### 7. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from a normal, local variable?

//Your Answer
instance variable are outside the class and the local variable is within the method.

//Googled Answer
An instance variable has a name beginning with @ , and its scope is confined to whatever object self refers to. Two different objects, even if they belong to the same class, are allowed to have different values for their instance variables.
Variables defined inside methods, constructors or blocks are called local variables. The variable will be declared and initialized within the method and it will be destroyed when the method has completed. Instance variables are variables within a class but outside any method.

#### 8. Ruby has a great community and tons of free resources to help you learn. Here is the long list of great resources: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/. Below are a few popular ones:
- Interactive Ruby tutorial (http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)
- Why's (poigniant) Guide to Ruby: comics, anecdotes, and microscopic canaries (http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html)
- Ruby in 20 min (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)


Choose one of these resources and go through the material (not for hours, only looking for around 10min of your time) then come back here and list a few new things you learned about Ruby.
