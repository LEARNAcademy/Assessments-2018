#### 1. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  

I think that getting familiarized with pair programming itself is the most helpful thing I've experienced this week. Before starting this course, I'll admit I had some reservations and skepticisms about coding with a partner. However, over the course of the week I have bought into the concept completely, and see how powerful it can be to the learning and development of these skills. It allows real-time feedback when you are writing code as the "driver", develops good communication skills as the "navigator", and it also opens your mind to conceptualizing alternative ideas and solutions. So embracing this new learning style and seeing its benefits first-hand has been the most helpful thing for me this week.
