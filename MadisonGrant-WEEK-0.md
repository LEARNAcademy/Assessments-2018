#### 1. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  

Go over code at the end of practicing/challenges! Sometimes I'm frustrated not because I don't understand, but because I know there is a simpler way to solve the problem at hand that I'm just not seeing. So working on code as a class after challenges definitely helps!
