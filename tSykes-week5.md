# Week 5 Assessment

Try your best to answer each question on your own before looking up the answer online. Once you're done writing your first answer, you can google the question and write the best answer you find.

### 1. What are some advantages of using Ruby on Rails?  
Rails is a framework from which we can build full stack apps. It has the Model, Controller, and View built in. Rails is easy to set up, very convenient for prototyping, and easy to use.

### 2. How does Ruby on Rails use the Model View Controller (MVC) framework?
route handles the http request, which triggers a method in controller.  The controller then either sends information to the view via an instance variable, or if necessary, sends request to model to retrieve, edit, update, delete info from database. Then can communicate back to the controller, which can then send info to the view to be displayed.

Googled answer: MVC covers the “separation of the concerns” among Models, Views and, Controllers. Each part has its own responsibility. The model maintains the relation with the database.This model object gains capabilities (inherited from ActiveRecord — Rails class) to retrieve, save, edit, and delete data from database table. The view is the presentation of the request’s response. The final result of a view will be probably the user interface of Client side.  The controller takes care of the flow: uses models to do queries, parses data, make decisions in which format you’ll present the data.
 

### 3. Using the information given, complete the steps for creating a new view in a rails app by filling in the blanks:

  1. Create a route:

  code:
  ```
  get '/about' => 'statics#about'
  ```
  file: config/routes

  2. Create the _Controller___________

  code:
  ```
  class __Statics__________ < ApplicationController

  def about
    ___render html: 'About Me' ____________________
  end
  ```

  file: __statics_contoller.rb ___________________

  3. Create the View

  code:

  ```
  <div>This is the About page!</div>
  ```

  file: _statics/about.html.erb____________________


### 4. Look at these sets of Rails routes, they are an example of which principle/term that we touched on briefly in class? Find the term, and explain why it is important.

```
/users/       method="GET"     # :controller => 'users', :action => 'index'
/users/1      method="GET"     # :controller => 'users', :action => 'show'
/users/new    method="GET"     # :controller => 'users', :action => 'new'
/users/       method="POST"    # :controller => 'users', :action => 'create'
/users/1/edit method="GET"     # :controller => 'users', :action => 'edit'
/users/1      method="PUT"     # :controller => 'users', :action => 'update'
/users/1      method="DELETE"  # :controller => 'users', :action => 'destroy'
```
Restful Routes map HTTP verbs and CRUD operations.

Googled answer: RESTful routes are important because they provide mapping between HTTP verbs, controller actions, and CRUD operations in a database. The different route patterns displays a blue print for us to follow when creating any restful web services or applications or even when building our own APIs.

### 5. What is the public folder used for in Rails?
Information in the public folder is immediately available to be viewed by user. Public pages are static, so they are typically used for more informational pages, ie About Me or similar non-interactive, unchanging information.

Googled answer: the public folder is used to serve static files. So for example, you often see 404.html, 500.html and favicon.ico files in there when creating the project through the "usual" means provided by such frameworks. These are "dumb" files that don't interact w/the backend. The assumption is that these don't require a context generated by your controllers to render them.

### 6. Write a rails route for a controller called "main" and a page called "game" that takes in a parameter called "guess"
get ‘/game/:guess’ => ‘main#game'

### 7. What are cookies for? How do they work? What is the difference between a session and a cookie?
Cookies save your browsing history on a particular site. A session saves the entire browsing history over the course of a one's browsing period, until they log off computer. (This was a complete guess)

googled answer: A cookie is a piece of text that a Web server can store on a user's hard disk. Cookies allow a Web site to store information on a user's machine and later retrieve it. The pieces of information are stored as name-value pairs. The main difference between a session and a cookie is that session data is stored on the server, whereas cookies store data in the visitor's browser. Sessions are more secure than cookies as it is stored on the server. Cookies can be turned off from the browser.

### 8. In an html form, what does the "action" attribute tell you about the form?  How do you designate the HTTP verb for the form?
The action attribute tells the destination of the request. Basically, this is how we connect input to the router. An example of the format is:
<form action = 'get' method = 'game'> ...  This then links to the routes code: get'/game'=> 'main#game'

Googled answer:  The action attribute specifies where to send the form-data when a form is submitted.

### 9. Why would you use an instance variable in a rails controller?
  An instance variable in the controller passes information from controller to view.   Without the ruby code, the page is just static.  

  Googled answer:  A view cannot call any of the controller's methods, but it can access the controller's instance variables. To pass data to the view, set an instance variable of the controller.

### 10. Name two rails generator commands and what files they create:
rails g scaffold Model name gives you fullstack app all the files for model, controller, view folder, route, etc. You can create a model or controller directly by entering  'rails generate'  plus Controller/Model and filename.  

googled answer:  A scaffold in Rails is a full set of model, database migration for that model, controller to manipulate it, views to view and manipulate the data, and a test suite for each of the above. Using generators will save you a large amount of time by writing boilerplate code, code that is necessary for the app to work.


### 11. Rails has a great community and lots of free tutorials to help you learn. Here is a list of some tutorials to choose from, choose one, do it, and then report back here at least one thing you learned. You can also use a different resource if you find one that you like better.
I learned that the (:references) keyword command is a special data type for models. It creates a new column on your database table with an '_id' that can hold integers.  Then the t.references line creates an integer column called 'name_id', an index for it, and a foreign key constraint that points to the id column of that specific table.  I also learned that pluralize is a rails helper that takes a number and a string as its arguments. If the number is greater than one, the string will be automatically pluralized.
