 //Googled Answer



To use the <link> tag to specify an external style sheet, follow these steps:

1) Define the style sheet.
External style sheets are very similar to the ones you already know. Just put all the styles in a separate text document without the <style> and </style> tags.

2) Create a link element in the HTML page’s head area to define the link between the HTML and CSS pages.
Example:
 <link rel = "stylesheet"
   type = "text/css"
   href = "myStyle.css" />
3) Set the link’s relationship by setting the rel = “stylesheet” attribute.
Honestly, stylesheet is almost the only relationship you’ll ever use, so this should become automatic.

4) Specify the type of style by setting type = “text/css“.

5)Determine the location of the style sheet with the href attribute.
