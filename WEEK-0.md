#### 1. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  

Peer programing has helped me the most. It is nice to work through a problem with another brain to bounce ideas off of. It is easy to get stuck in a way of thinking even if it is wrong. Since some of my peers are more advanced that I am, it has been really helpful for me to be able to learn from them and ask them questions.
