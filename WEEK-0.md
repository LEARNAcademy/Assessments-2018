#### 1. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  

This week has been full of learning opportunities for me; however, there is one thing that has stuck out in my mind the most. That is, I think the morning activities with Damon helped me realize the most about communication and collaboration. Overall, it felt like it helped me grow as a person and peer.
