#### 1. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  

I would say the live code examples during lectures is the tool that has helped me the most so far in class. Concepts being explained alone is important as an introduction, but towards the end when we get to see examples and code outcome immediately, that gives a great opportunity to grasp each character/line in the code, what it's doing, what type of input it needs, why it's acting that way, and how other parts of the code affect it.

Having a thorough introduction and explanation of GitHub has also been fantastic. It is confusing on its own, but facing it alone can be a mess when your starting point is googling "define repository". Getting it explained and being able to test it out on our own machines is great.
