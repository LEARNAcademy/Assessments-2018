#### 1. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  

<!-- Answer: From this week, one thing that helped me learn the most was the code drills. It challenged what I learned and retained throughout the week. The peer-paring was also helpful, but sometimes it's difficult to remember what it is that I personally know/remember. It also helps me to practice thinking through problems in a limited time and goal. The code drill also helped point out what I don't know, go through what I didn't understand on the spot, and thus reinforce information that I missed the day before or during practice.// -->
